I was sick of bad and incosistent visualisation of Corona figures.
Hence I did it myself. It will be updated whenever I get to it (~daily).

Sources for the data are in general:
Johns Hopkins Data from github https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19
Yes there are strange time skews, sorry for that.

German States are taken from Robert Koch Institute: https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Fallzahlen.html
As well as from the corresponding Wikipedia Article: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19-Epidemie_in_Deutschland#cite_note-RKI-2

The code for data input and visualisation is based on this gitub repo https://github.com/joaotinti75/coronavirus.git.
I made use of pandas and matplotlib
The code to regenerate this (together with the RKI data) is here: https://github.com/marcvs/Coronavirus
